Truthfully, I kinda threw myself into a bad spot here. I was needing to teach myself a lot and waited very last minute to do it, as a result it's just... not good. There's code that probably runs and the bones of a project here. I couldn't just turn in nothing. I feel embarrassed writing this... but I feel I have no choice. It's not a good project but it's better than nothing and I will be doing better next time and not just trying to stitch things together in an hour.
