Truthfully, I kinda threw myself into a bad spot here. I was needing to teach myself a lot and waited very last minute to do it, 
as a result it's just... not good. There's code that probably runs and the bones of a project here. 
I couldn't just turn in nothing. I feel embarrassed writing this... but I feel I have no choice.
